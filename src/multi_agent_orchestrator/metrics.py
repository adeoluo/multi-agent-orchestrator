"""Metrics over an orchestrated run.

An orchestration is only improvable if it is measured. :func:`run_metrics` reads a finished
run's blackboard and reports how much work it took: subtask counts, how many attempts the
critic forced (a proxy for wasted effort), which workers were used, and the completion
rate. These are the numbers to watch when tuning a planner, workers, or the critic.
